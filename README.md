# Artificial Intelligence University Project

This repository contains the exercises and projects completed as part of the **"Artificial Intelligence"** course at Technical University of Crete. The course material is divided into two exercise sets, each focusing on core concepts and algorithms in artificial intelligence.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository is structured into **two exercise sets**, covering foundational and advanced topics in AI. Below is a summary of the topics explored in each set:

### **Exercise Set 1: Problem-Solving and Optimization**
1. **Search Algorithms**  
   - Implementation of uninformed and informed search strategies.
2. **Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
   - Game-playing algorithms for adversarial environments, optimized with alpha-beta pruning.
3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**  
   - Modeling and solving CSPs using backtracking and heuristic techniques.
4. **Simulated Annealing**  
   - Probabilistic optimization for approximating global minima in large search spaces.

### **Exercise Set 2: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**
1. **Propositional Logic**  
   - Implementation of truth tables, resolution, and SAT solvers for logical inference.
2. **First-Order Logic**  
   - Modeling real-world problems using quantifiers, predicates, and unification algorithms.
